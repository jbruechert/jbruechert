You found the profile of a KDE Developer, currently mainly working on 
* [🚂 Transitous](https://transitous.org)
* [📱 Plasma Mobile](https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/)
* a few smaller KDE apps.

I'm helping out at many other projects, for example
* [📦 flathub](https://github.com/flathub)
* [🏫 OpenBoard](https://github.com/openboard-org/openboard)

Most of my stuff is not on GitHub, check out https://gitlab.spline.de/jbb/, https://gitlab.com/jbb/, https://codeberg.org/jbb/ and https://invent.kde.org/jbbgameich as well.

In the past (and sometimes still today) I worked on some of the following projects:
* [🗨️ Kaidan](https://invent.kde.org/network/kaidan)
* [📲 Plasma Mobile for Debian](https://gitlab.com/debian-pm/)
* 👾 Minetest Mods & Texture packs
* Halium

Programming languages I especially like:
 * Rust
 * Haskell
 * C++
 * QML
 * PureScript
 * Python is kind of fine too I guess
